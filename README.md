Synthetic particle image velocimetry (PIV) &amp; particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) image generator based on an assumed Gaussian light scattering from tracer particles.  Generates displacement gradients, linear translations, and combinations of the two as well as out of plane motion while dealing with particles arriving and leaving at boundaries.
